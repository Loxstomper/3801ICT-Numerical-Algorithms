# Create a floating point number-set for a computer using 7 bit words (1 st for sign, 3 for signed exponent and 3 for mantissa). Determine the smallest and largest possible numbers and identify some of the numbers that can be represented.

## Structure

[sign, signed exponent, signed exponent, signed exponent, mantissa, mantissa, mantissa]

- sign bit of 1 means negative

m.b^e

- mass
- base
- exponent

## Smallest number

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

-7.2^7 = -896

## Largest number

[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

7.2^7 = 896
